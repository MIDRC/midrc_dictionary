  associated_id:
    description: The submitter_id of the record associated with this data. For example, if this annotation is associated with an imaging_study record, the value of this property would be the submitter_id of that imaging study. Only one submitter_id is allowed per annotation row. To submit the same enumerated value for a second submitter_id, an additional annotation record is required.
    type: string

  associated_type:
    description: The node ID where the 'associated_id' can be found. For example, if this annotation is associated with a particular Imaging Study, 'imaging_study' would be used as the 'associated_type', while 'associated_id' would contain the specific submitter_id of the associated record in the imaging_study node.

  flanders_note:
    description: By using a Chest Radiograph fused to a CT Chest, the Flanders Coefficient for the patient was returned and a subsequent Flanders COVID likelihood determined.
