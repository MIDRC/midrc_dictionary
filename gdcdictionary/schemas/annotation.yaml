description: Information describing characteristics of imaging studies, series and instances (e.g., segmentations, bounding boxes, feature labels) and inferences based on those characteristics (e.g., predicted diagnoses). Annotations may be recorded in the course of clinical care or retrospectively for purposes of research (e.g., imaging annotations from PACS or retrospective labeling tools). Please refer to https://midrc.org/annotations to learn more about a particular batch of annotations.

  airspace_disease_grading:
    description: Values are extracted from the annotation file midrc_mdai_chestxr. Accepted values are "mild" opacities (1-2 lung zones), "moderate" opacities (3-4 lung zones), and "severe" opacities (>4 lung zones).
    enum:
        - mild
        - moderate
        - severe

  annotator_id:
    description: Coded value to represent a particular annotator in a group. These need only be unique per annotation.
    type: string

  annotation_method:
    description: Defines the method by which the annotation was created. Clinically_derived - Based on information produced in the process of the subject's medical care; Retrospective_expert - Based on information produced retrospective to the subject's care by annotators with relevant special clinical expertise; Retrospective_general - Based on information produced retrospective to the subject's care by annotators without relevant special clinical expertise; Retrospective_auto - Based on information produced retrospective to the subject's care using automated means.
    enum:
        - Clinically_derived
        - Retrospective_expert
        - Retrospective_general
        - Retrospective_auto

  class_covid19_pneumonia:
    description: Values are extracted from the annotation file midrc_mdai_chestxr; Accepted values include "typical" appearance, which is multifocal bilateral, peripheral opacities, or opacities with rounded morphology, lower lung-predominant distribution;  "indeterminate" appearance, which is absence of typical findings and unilateral, central or upper lung predominant distribution of airspace disease; "atypical" appearance, which is pneumothorax or pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, lobar consolidation, solitary lung nodule, or mass diffuse tiny nodules cavity; "negative" for pneumonia, which is no lung opacities.
