  airspace_disease_grading:
    description: Values are extracted from the annotation file midrc_mdai_chestxr. Accepted values are "mild" opacities (1-2 lung zones), "moderate" opacities (3-4 lung zones), and "severe" opacities (>4 lung zones).
    enum:
        - mild
        - moderate
        - severe

  class_covid19_pneumonia:
    description: Values are extracted from the annotation file midrc_mdai_chestxr; Accepted values include "typical" appearance, which is multifocal bilateral, peripheral opacities, or opacities with rounded morphology, lower lung-predominant distribution;  "indeterminate" appearance, which is absence of typical findings and unilateral, central or upper lung predominant distribution of airspace disease; "atypical" appearance, which is pneumothorax or pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, lobar consolidation, solitary lung nodule, or mass diffuse tiny nodules cavity; "negative" for pneumonia, which is no lung opacities.
    enum:
        - atypical
        - indeterminate
        - negative
        - typical

  midrc_mRALE_score:
    description: Values are extracted from the annotation file mRALE_Mastermind_Challenge.

A normal chest radiograph receives a score of 0, while a chest radiograph with complete consolidation of both lungs receives the maximum score of 24.
