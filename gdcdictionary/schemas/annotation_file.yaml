  annotation_name:
    description: The name of the annotation. These names are unique and assigned by MIDRC. Annotation names reference a document posted on the MIDRC website describing the annotation, methods and values expected.  All MIDRC created annotations start with ‘midrc_’.
    type: string

  # associated_id:
  #   description: The submitter_id of the record associated with this data. For example, if this annotation is associated with an imaging_study record, the value of this property would be the submitter_id of that imaging study. Only one submitter_id is allowed per annotation row. To submit the same enumerated value for a second submitter_id, an additional annotation record is required.
  #   type: string
  #
  # associated_type:
  #   description: The node ID where the 'associated_id' can be found. For example, if this annotation is associated with a particular Imaging Study, 'imaging_study' would be used as the 'associated_type', while 'associated_id' would contain the specific submitter_id of the associated record in the imaging_study node.
